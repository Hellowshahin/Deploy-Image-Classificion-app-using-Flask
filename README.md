# Deploy-Image-Classificion-app-using-Flask-
CNN based image classification app. A python based Desktop Demo App. This app used for real time testing purpose. 

## Introduction
This is a deep learning project. I used Convolutional Neural Networks to classify MNIST handwritten data. For more convenient propose of test data, used flask microweb framework to deploy it in a server and then you can access and test it remotely from any desktop browser. You can also test it from your desktop localhost.

## How to use my code
First you have to:
1. cnn.py  => Train this CNN model from scratch and save weight as h5 file
2. app.py => then run this file 

before running app.py file some file you have to make previusly. 
1. index.html => this is the file which you want to show in browser
2. some CSS snd java_script file. You can find it from static folder.

## Dependencies:
-python 3
-Tensorflow
-Keras
-Numpy
-Pillow
-flask

## Datasets:
I used MNIST hand_written digit dataset.....

#### Dataset - MNIST
#### Classes - 10
#### Train images	- 60000
#### Validation images - 10000
