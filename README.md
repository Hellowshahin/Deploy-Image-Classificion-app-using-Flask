# Deploy-Image-Classificion-app-using-Flask-
CNN based image classification app. A python based Desktop Demo App. This app used for real time testing purpose. 

## Introduction
This is a deep learning project. I used Convolutional Neural Networks to classify MNIST handwritten data. For more convenient propose of test data, used flask microweb framework to deploy it in a server and then you can access and test it remotely from any desktop browser. You can also test it from your desktop localhost.
